# Flexible requirements for CI / MCP / AI
# --------------------------------------
# Notes:
# - Ranges keep you forward-compatible while avoiding major breaking changes.
# - Install Playwright browsers after deps:  `python -m playwright install`
# - Pin only if your CI reveals incompatibilities; otherwise keep ranges.
