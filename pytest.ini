# Markers for test categorization
markers =
    smoke: Quick sanity checks; fast-running tests (typically < 30s)
    regression: Full regression suite; comprehensive coverage
    sanity: Sanity checks; quick validation before full runs
    ui: UI-focused tests
    api: API-focused tests
    slow: Slow-running tests (> 30s); useful for parallel filtering
